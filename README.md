# Challenge 1: Semantic HTML
An example of semantic HTML

## Description
This project was done to understand the importance of HTML semantics and CSS optimization. <br>
I was given a webpage that needed HTML elements to be updated to be more semantically correct as well as a CSS stylesheet that need optimization.<br>
The content of the webpage decribes the importance of search engine optimization which I will be practicing on the remainder of the projects in this course.<br>
